                The number φ turns up frequently in geometry, particularly in figures with pentagonal symmetry. The length of a regular pentagon's diagonal is φ times its side. 
                The vertices of a regular icosahedron are those of three mutually orthogonal golden rectangles.
                There is no known general algorithm to arrange a given number of nodes evenly on a sphere, for any of several definitions of even distribution (see, for example, Thomson problem).
                However, a useful approximation results from dividing the sphere into parallel bands of equal surface area and placing one node in each band at longitudes spaced by a golden section of the circle, i.e. 360°/φ ≅ 222.5°.
                 This method was used to arrange the 1500 mirrors of the student-participatory satellite Starshine-3.
